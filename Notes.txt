ReadySetZerg had a decent set of ideas:
- remove a bullet from the bot gun so you have a higher chance of the gun clicking next time you get muted
- ability to nuke a word for 1 minute (auto-aegis at end)
- ability to purchase a name color for dgg (excluding specific ones for VIP/non-sub)
- ability to purchase a flair of an emote (YEE vs PEPE)
