Ideas in thread:
Results:
+ = Definite
* = Future state
- = Probs not

+ Specialization: Realm grinder has great specs. Choose x and you'll do 1 and 2 better. Choose y and you'll do 1 really well, but 2 and 3 more poorly.
+ "Events"
+ A "grandmapocalypse" type end game like cookie clicker
+ CPU bosses
+ Flairs for leaderboard
+ Daily login bonuses
+ Missions
+ More than one resource

 
* Stats page
* Clans = determined on the leaderboard, less in game 
* Clan leaderboard
* "dungeon progression"
* "gacha system"
* (user choices affect next season) Community paths (whichever item has the most upgrades the next season those would be nerfed etc.)
* Achievements
* Avatars that can unlock on d.gg - Or in the clicker game environment?
* Leaderboard rewards
* Mechanics that help the streamer
* "colonisation of some auto-generated map w/ the points you earn"
* Ability to attack/assist others
* Flairs for DGG

ReadySetZerg had a decent set of ideas:
- remove a bullet from the bot gun so you have a higher chance of the gun clicking next time you get muted
- ability to nuke a word for 1 minute (auto-aegis at end)
- ability to purchase a name color for dgg (excluding specific ones for VIP/non-sub)
- ability to purchase a flair of an emote (YEE vs PEPE)

- bonuses for farming emotes
- "unban mechanic"
- Earn points towards chat bans
- Make chatting in dgg generate points

A fail state (in this case fail state is doing poorly)
? Progression goals
